# PCB
## Versions
There are two versions of the PCB in this repository. One which makes use of an external dash-cam battery such as the BlackVue B-130X and one which uses the vehicle battery directly. These are located in their respective sub-folders.

The project is built with the external battery version in mind as that's what I intend to use, however as it presents an additional financial barrier the PCB for the alternative version exists too.

Please note that, while cheaper and smaller in overall form factor, the no-battery version has the potential to drain your vehicles battery and offers no low-voltage protection on its own.

## Modifications
The editable project files for each PCB is included within each sub-folder under "Project Files". The PCBs were designed using the Standard Edition of [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com). Other software exists such as the open source KiCad and the commercial software EAGLE.

After giving each of these a try, I found EasyEDA had the softest learning curve for both myself and anyone wanting to make modifications, as well as the virtue of offering an in-browser editor thereby making it even more accessible.

Either way, feel free to import and modify using a software of your preference and (as always) consider contributing back any improvements you may come up with.

## Ordering
Included in each of the PCB directories is a Gerber file which may be used to order prints of the PCBs from providers such as JLCPCB and PCBWay. It's a fairly standard format and should be accepted by most PCB printing providers.
