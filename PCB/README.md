## PCB Modifications
The PCB was designed using the Standard Edition of [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com). Other software exists such as the open source KiCad and the commercial software EAGLE.

After giving each of these a try, I found EasyEDA had the softest learning curve for both myself and anyone wanting to make modifications, as well as the virtue of offering an in-browser editor thereby making it even more accessible.

Either way, feel free to import and modify using a software of your preferance and (as always) consider contributing back any improvements you may come up with.
